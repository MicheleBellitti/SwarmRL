# SwarmRL: Reinforcement Learning in Swarm Intelligence

SwarmRL is a simulation project that explores the application of reinforcement learning algorithms within swarm intelligence scenarios, aiming at assessing the effectiveness of RL on multi-agent systems(MARL). It has been developed as the final project of the postgraduateâ€™s course of Distributed Artifical Intelligence.

## Features

- **Interactive Simulation**: Real-time control over the simulation environment, allowing users to play, pause, and adjust parameters on the fly.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Comprehensive dashboard for analyzing the behavior of agents within the simulation, including performance metrics and visualizations.
- **Extensible Framework**: Designed with modularity in mind, enabling easy integration of new algorithms and simulation scenarios.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed on your system. This project relies on several key Python libraries, including numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and plotly and pygame.

Install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MicheleBellitti/SwarmRL.git
   cd SwarmRL
    ```

2. Run the simulation for a quick demo:

   ```bash
   python simulate.py
   ```
## Future Enhancements

- Algorithm Integration: Adding support for more reinforcement learning algorithms to explore a wider range of behaviors and scenarios.
- Improved Visualization: Enhancing the dashboard with more interactive elements and detailed analytics to offer deeper insights into the simulation.
- Community Contributions: Opening the platform for community-driven scenarios, algorithms, and improvements.-->
