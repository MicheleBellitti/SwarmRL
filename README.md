## Features

- **Interactive Simulation**: Real-time control over the simulation environment, allowing users to play, pause, and adjust parameters on the fly.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Comprehensive dashboard for analyzing the behavior of agents within the simulation, including performance metrics and visualizations.
- **Extensible Framework**: Designed with modularity in mind, enabling easy integration of new algorithms and simulation scenarios.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed on your system. This project relies on several key Python libraries, including Flask, Dash, and RLlib.

Install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SwarmRL.git
   cd SwarmRL
    ```

<!-- 2. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python app/app.py
   ``` -->
3. or simply run the simulation for a quick demo:

   ```bash
   python simulate.py
   ```

<!-- Navigate to <http://localhost:5000> in your web browser to access the web application dashboard. >
